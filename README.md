Each folder corresponds to one or multiple related manuscript figures.
Most figures can be generated directly by downloading this repository, as the results of the inference are saved.

For Figures 5, 6, 7, S4, S5 and S10 the results of the inference are NOT saved here. We provide the code to run the inference and the code to generate the figures.
